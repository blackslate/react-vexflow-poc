# React-Vexflow Proof of Concept #

Copied from [https://codesandbox.io/s/react-xktjir](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-xktjir)

Two unnecessary lines in `src/Example.js` were removed.

> npm reports than `"react-vexflow": "^0.0.4"` is incompatible with `"react": "18.2.0"`, but using `npm --force i` seems to work.
